### Issues Encountered

#### Resolved

   - Initially had problems with `authMiddleware` import
   - Resolved by using correct import path from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

2. React version compatibility:
   - Encountered peer dependency conflicts with Clerk and React 19

   - Set up error logging and monitoring

5. **Security**:

   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Set up proper CORS policies

### Notes
- Consider implementing a development environment configuration guide
- Document the authentication flow for future reference
- May need to revisit middleware configuration as routes are added
